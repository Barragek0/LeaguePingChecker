# As of 2022, this no longer works by default, as Riot have prevented pings to these 'datacenter' servers.
You can define your own IPs by editing the settings file at %userprofile%/LeaguePingChecker/settings.txt

These are the IPs i'm using for EUW currently:
  - euw2=104.160.141.2
  - euw1=91.198.174.192

If you're on a server other than EUW, you'll need to find IPs of websites that are hosted in your region, for example, your countries' government website. This might be a hard task though, best of luck.

# LeaguePingChecker
