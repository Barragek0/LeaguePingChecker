# As of 2022, this no longer works by default, as Riot have prevented pings to these 'datacenter' servers.
You can define your own IPs by editing the file at %userprofile%/LeaguePingChecker

I only have one currently, for EUW, which is a website that is almost always online, but if you're on another server you'll need to find your own IP to use.

These are the IPs i'm using for EUW currently:
euw2=104.160.141.2
euw1=91.198.174.192

# LeaguePingChecker
An open-source application coded in Java for League of Legends that automatically checks your ping and displays it on the taskbar.
